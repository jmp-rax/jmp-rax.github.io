I'm a low level (often times embedded) software engineer fascinated with learning new technologies. I have written everything from linux and windows application code to embeded device code. I love tackling challenges and expanding my experiencies. 

When I'm not wearing my software engineering hat, I'm wearing my reverse engineering hat. I enjoy ripping apart application software, kernels, and embedded devices. Often times I'm just curious how something works other times I'm curious if I can add new features to something old.
